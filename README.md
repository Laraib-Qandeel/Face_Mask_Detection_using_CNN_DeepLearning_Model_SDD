# Software Design Document (SDD)

## Project Title
**Face Mask Detection using CNN Deep Learning**

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Design Document (SDD) is to provide a comprehensive technical description of the design for the **Face Mask Detection using CNN Deep Learning** project.  
This document explains the system architecture, data design, component design (CNN model), and implementation details required for development, testing, and maintenance.

---

### 1.2 Scope
The primary scope of the system is to accurately classify an input image of a human face into one of two categories:

- **With Mask**
- **Without Mask**

The system is implemented using a deep learning model trained on a supervised image dataset.  
The scope includes data acquisition, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.  

The system **does not include deployment** into a real-time application such as a web or mobile system.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a standard **Deep Learning pipeline architecture** and is divided into three main components:

- Data Pipeline
- Model Component
- Evaluation Component

---

### 2.1 High-Level Design
The system operates in a sequential manner:

1. Data Acquisition: Raw image data is collected from a public dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Images are cleaned, resized, and normalized.
3. Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train the CNN model.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a test dataset.

---

### 2.2 Component Diagram (Logical View)

The system is developed using Python and the TensorFlow/Keras framework.

| Component | Technology / Library | Function |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Data Acquisition | Kaggle API, zipfile | Downloads and extracts dataset |
| Data Preprocessing | OS, PIL, NumPy, Sklearn | Image loading, resizing, normalization, train-test split |
| Model Component | TensorFlow / Keras | CNN model definition and training |
| Evaluation Component | TensorFlow, Matplotlib | Accuracy and loss evaluation |

## 3. Data Design

### 3.1 Dataset and Structure
The project uses the **Face Mask Dataset** obtained from Kaggle.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Source | Kaggle (omkargurav/face-mask-dataset) |
| Total Samples | ~7,553 images |
| Classes | 2 |
| Class 0 | Without Mask (3,828 images) |

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline
The following preprocessing steps are applied:

1. Image loading using PIL library  
2. Resizing images to **128 × 128 pixels**  
3. Conversion to RGB color format  
4. Conversion to NumPy arrays with shape `(128, 128, 3)`  
5. Normalization of pixel values from `0–255` to `0–1`  
6. Train-test split (80:20)

## 4. Component Design: CNN Model

The core component of the system is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented using the Keras Sequential API.
